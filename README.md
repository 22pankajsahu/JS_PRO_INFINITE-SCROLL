## How it Works

The Infinite Scroll web application uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide its seamless scrolling and image loading functionality. Here's a high-level overview of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: When the web page loads, it initializes and displays a loader.

2. **Fetching Images**: It makes API requests to Unsplash to fetch a set of random images. These images are displayed on the page as thumbnails in a responsive grid.

3. **Infinite Scrolling**: As the user scrolls down the page, the application detects when they have reached the bottom of the page. When this happens, it triggers another API request to fetch more images. This gives the illusion of infinite scrolling.

4. **Image Viewer**: When the user clicks on a thumbnail image, a detailed view of that image is displayed. This view includes the full-size image, its title, and the option to visit the source on Unsplash.

5. **Lazy Loading**: Images are loaded lazily, meaning they are fetched and displayed only when they are in the user's viewport. This approach improves page load times and overall performance.

## Usage

1. Open the file in your web browser.
2. Scroll down to discover more images.
3. Click on an image to view additional details.
4. Enjoy an endless stream of captivating images!
